# AI-Driven-Financial-News-Sentiment-Analysis
Developed an AI-driven system leveraging BERT, a LLM (Large Language Model) to perform sentiment analysis on financial news articles


Description: I created a Python script where a user can input a financial news article, the date, and the ticker symbol for the stock the article correlates to. Using BERT, an LLM, trained with PyTorch, the script analyzes the article for positive, negative, or natural sentiment.

I created a simple HTML web page that is locally hosted using Flask to get user input. The page displayed the changes in the stock closing price 4 days before and after the article date to display it with the sentiment score to measure correlation.
